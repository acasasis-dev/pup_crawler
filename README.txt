Download Python 3.6.5 here: 
	32-bit: "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe"
	64-bit: "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-amd64.exe"
Open the downloaded file and check "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" before clicking "Install Now"
Run "pup.py", if some text like "Collecting ***..." popped up, don't close it, its just means that it's installing dependencies that are not still on your computer, after it finished, you can run the script faster 
That's it you're all set ...
